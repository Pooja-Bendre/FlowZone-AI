# 🚀 FlowZone AI: Focus Coach & Productivity Tracker
# ✨ The Problem: The Focus Crisis
In today's digital world, deep work is collapsing. Users are constantly battling distractions, struggling to build effective habits, and lacking personalized guidance to enter and maintain a state of "flow." Generic productivity apps fail to connect advice with real-time user behavior.

Problem 1: Generic Advice: Most "coaches" offer one-size-fits-all tips (e.g., "close tabs"). They don't know your current streak, flow score, or actual distraction patterns.

Problem 2: Friction: Productivity tools often feel like another chore. Logging and asking questions requires too much effort, breaking concentration.
